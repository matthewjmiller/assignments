I enjoyed the freedom to choose what to write about. I felt confident at the beginning of the paper, but as it progressed I felt more and more unready. The introduction threw me for a loop, I was never really sure what to say in it. I missed format more than I expected. I am awful at spelling and found myself second guessing the word choice constantly. I knew what I wanted my paper to look like, but it never seemed to come together. Overall I did learn quiet a bit about markdown.
