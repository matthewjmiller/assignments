# How To Raise Broilers For a Fair

## Flock Type
The first step in this project is to pick what breed of birds you want to raise. There are so many different breeds of chickens in the world, you need to find the one that fit your specific needs. Since this is a broiler project, a meat type bird would be the best choice. Here are a few great breeds to use for this project: 

! List:  Cornish, White Plymouth Rock, Brahma, Orpington, Cornish/White Plymouth Rock 
 
Commercial broiler producers typically use the Cornish/Plymouth Rock cross for their meat production. This cross is an extremely fast-growing hybrid, bred to efficiently convert feed to meat. This particular cross, feathers out rather fast and has the desired yellow skin. Any of the above breeds would get the job done, just check the local feed store and see what breeds they have available. The broilers should put on about one pound per week, and reach somewhere between 5-8 pounds. Therefore, the project usually takes six to seven weeks to get the birds to their mature weight.  

## Houseing/Enclosure
The best time to raise chick is in the late spring or summer, because the brooding/ housing requirements are a lot less. The facility and space broilers need during brooding does not need to be complicated or costly. People brood their chicks in all kinds of places like the corner of the garage, shed, barn, or other buildings using simple temporary pens. The brooding pens are usually between 2-3 feet tall, as long as the chicks are safe for other animals. The possibilities are endless when it comes to building a pen: cardboard, kiddy pools, plastic containers, chicken wire, chipboard, or just about anything.Chicks need half a square foot of brooding space per chick for the first four weeks.

There are an endless number of places a flock of chickens can be kept. After the brooding period (this will be discussed later on), the chickens can be reared in a coop, stock trailer, fenced-in range/yard, or barn as long as they have shelter to protect them from the elements. THe growing birds need one square foot of space for weeks four through seven. The building/shelter needs to have openings on two or three sides, so there will be plenty of fresh air for the broilers as they grow larger. However, the openings will need to be closed or covered during cold weather.

## Bedding
There should always be about 2-4 inches of dry litter on the floor for young chicks. When moved into the grow out pen there should always be about 3-6 inches of dry litter. The best material to use for the bedding is rice hulls, sawdust, cane fiber, or dried peat moss. Avoid cedar or treated wood chips, because they can be toxic to the birds. Shredded newspaper and ground hay make poor bedding; they aren’t very absorbent and they tend to cake up and stay damp. The floor of the shelter has to be kept dry, to keep the broilers happy and healthy. If the floor get wet and slippery the chickens could injure themselves. If the litter gets packed and gross the birds could become sick.   

## Brooding
**Chick Temperature At Various Stage**
1 day- 1 week 90°F
1–2 weeks 85°F
2–3 weeks 80°F  
3–4 weeks 75°F
4 weeks–adult 70°F

The first week of a chick's life is the most important. They need to proper heat in order to grow. If the chicks get cold they will not grow properly, but if they are too hot they can become dehydrated. Therefore, it is best to begin heating the pen 24 hours before the chicks arrive. Heat lamps are usually available at a hardware store. It is important to check the temperature at floor level, since that is where the chicks are. So, keep a thermometer in the pen at the same height as the birds. After the first week gradually bring the temperature down by five degrees each week. Electric heat lamps with aluminum reflectors/shields are great short-term heat sources, for the young chicks. 125-watt infrared bulbs are recommended. It is best to hang the lamp or lamps about 18 inches off the surface of the litter. Be sure the lamps are fastened securely so they cannot fall and catch the litter on fire. Place the feeders pretty close to the lamps and make sure the waterers are far enough away so water cannot splash up and hit the lamps.

## Water
One five-gallon waterer will be sufficient for 50 starting chicks. Just be sure it is kept clean, fresh, and filled at all times-this is what make automatic waterers so handy.

## Feeding
One major part of growing broilers is the feed. You will need to teach the chicks to eat during the first two days by putting them in the feeders, that way it is easy to find and they learn what is eatable and what is not. For the first two weeks you will need to allow 1 inch of feeder space per chick. Then for weeks three through seven allow the birds 2 inches of feeder space. You should be able to get all the proper feed you need from your local feed store like, Powell, Tractor Supply, or Race Brother. The starter feed is usually fed for the first six weeks, and then at seven weeks it should be time to switch to the finisher feed.When stiching feed make sure this change is not abrupt, slowly integrate the new feed into their diet. The two important things to remember when feeding chickens is, keep the edge of the feeder the same height as the chicken’s back and never fill the feeders more than half full or the chick will just waste it.  

## Know Your Chicks
Good flock managers become familiar with the birds by listening and watching them. Happy birds are always chirping softly and are active; while sick birds chirp loud and huddle together. “NEVER make rapid or drastic changes in the environment unless birds are in danger or dying” (Watkins 3). Be sure to check on the birds at least twice a day.
