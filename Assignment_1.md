# How to raise broiler chickens for the state fair
My audience would be parents looking to help their children participate in the local fairs. They would have some knowledge of the jargon, but it needs to be relatively simple. I will not be able to use chronological order. I will section the paper out into different categories like: Flock type, Housing, Brooding, Bedding, Spacing, Water, Feed, Health, Selecting, and Show Preparation. Each section will start by describing the needs of young birds and end with the needs of older birds.
